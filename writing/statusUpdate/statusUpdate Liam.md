#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
We have created our sqlite data base with a schema and imported data into our table. We have created our python file that connects to our sqlite database that has built in format for users to choose which query they would like to conduct.
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
We have to fill out our query options based on research questions, right now the format is blank, and also possibly create another table for our data to increase robustness.
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
We have submitted a text sqlite file with our database with data inside it and a python file that connects to our sqlite database and will allow the user to choose a query.
```
