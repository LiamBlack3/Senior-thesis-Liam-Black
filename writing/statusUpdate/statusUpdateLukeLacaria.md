 - What is the title of this work?

 ```
 NBA Playoff Touch Statistics
 ```

 - Data Reference:

 ```
 https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches/?Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Playoffs
 ```
#### Five Intellectual Research Questions of Scholarship

 - Question 1

 ```
 Do players change where they touch the basketball in the playoffs?
 ```

 - Question 2

 ```
 What locations produce the most successful shots in the playoffs?
 ```

 - Question 3

 ```
 What do the top tier players do differently in respect to touch location during the playoffs?
 ```

 - Question 4

 ```
 Do dribbles per touch correlate with scoring?
 ```

 - Question 5
 
 ```
 Do small forwards do better with a high amount of paint or elbow touches?
 ```

#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
We started by gathering our data from NBA.com and exporting it as a .tab file. We then used this data to create a database containing the data of touches in the 2020-2021 NBA Playoffs. After, we began implementing a Python program that allows the user to interact with the database with little technical knowledge.
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
We will continue to implement our Python interface. This will allow our database to be accessible to more users. We will also need to further verify the correctness of the data within our table, as well as make sure our table design is optimal. This will ensure that no data is improperly collected or formatted, leading to as accurate of a table as is possible.
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
The code we have submitted thus far is a Python menu coupled with data and an SQLite database that works to store and display information about the hand tracking data in the 2020-2021 NBA Playoffs. Below is a screenshot of what the Python interface would look like for a user. The program will allow users to query the database using keywords in Python.
```
