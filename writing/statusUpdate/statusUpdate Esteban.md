 ```

#### Progress

- Steps I /we have taken already:

```
I have created the python file with the data inside that was the menu and the interaction with the user. In the other hand, we have created the data file with the data already inside it, in which already displays the data in an sqlite3 file and works perfectly. 
```

- Steps that I /we will take:

```
The steps that we will have to take to finish the project strong, is to make sure that the python file and the data is separated by tabs and that it is displaying the correct data. Also, that the queries are done right displaying the data that was asked and not other things. 
```

#### Code Sample

- What is the submitted code and how does it help to accomplish the research goals of this project?

```
The submitted code is with the menu in python in which is going to run the queries form the menu that the user can select, right now still in development with the queries. This helps accomplish the research goals of the project, because the project has been created for people to see the data and make it clear for people to analyze data from the NBA. 
```

 - Screenshots of submitted code in action.

```
Inside the writing folder, there is a foler with the screenshot of what we have now of the code working.
