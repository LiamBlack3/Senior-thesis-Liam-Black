# Linear Regression Analysis of Basketballs Top Offensive Strategies Throughout The Decades

Basketball has changed throughout the decades. From bully ball in the late 90’s to big man dominance in the 2000’s to a three point shooting bonanza in the 2010’s the high level play of the nba has yielded many effective strategies, but which one(s) are the best? 

My project aims to look at the winningest teams through decades and analyze and compare the in depth scoring statistics for the top teams to see what offensive strategies teams run based on the strengths of their team to generate the most possible wins per season. For this project I will be analyzing team offensive data from 1995 up until the 2022 season. By completing a linear regression analysis looking at player and team tendency statistics compared to win percentage, my tool will allow coaches and NBA fans to see offensive schemes that have the highest probility to yield high volume win seasons.

The three main questions my tool will be able to answer are:
- What are top offensive strategies teams have used and how effective are they?
- How have these strategies evolved or faded away over time?
- How to coaches best tailor their offenses to their team's strengths?


My program uses a python file that is output to an interactive dashboard on streamlit. 

# How to run
```
streamlit run <name_of_file>
